Dear Filiberto Tawil,
Everything in our store will be 20% off between now and the end of April! Stock up on our logo mugs, T shirts, and water bottles to show your support and help raise awareness. Our magnets, plushies, and picture books, also make great gifts for the children in your life. 

Remember, all proceeds go to support our work and, if we can reach our goal of $10,000 in sales by the end of April, an anonymous donor has pledged to match every $1 you spend. Want to help out but don’t want to buy stuff? Visit our website to make a donation.

Sincerely, 

Non-Profit Director
